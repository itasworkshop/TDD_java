TDD --> whenever you write a program you write respective test case for it too

calculator --> addition,subration etc

addition(20,30) --> 50
addition(10.5,10.5) --> 21

Unit test cases --> instead of manullly testing the unit funtionality we automate it with desired inputs and expected output

take 20 and 30 in addition function and expect/assert that output is 50 in this case.

TDD says writing test cases parrallel to devlopment.

new feature in app --> change your test cases also.

TDD --> 
1. Adding a new test case
new feature --> new test cases
2. Run all test.
so that it should not break other.
3. simplest approach to the code that will pass test case
4. All the test cases should pass.
5. Refactore.

Rules
1. no duplicates
2. standard names --> Calculator --> TestCalculator
@Test
